## What is a web crawler?
Web crawling and web scraping are two different but related concepts. Web crawling is a component of web scraping, the crawler logic finds URLs to be processed by the scraper code.

A web crawler starts with a list of URLs to visit, called the seed. For each URL, the crawler finds links in the HTML, filters those links based on some criteria and adds the new links to a queue. All the HTML or some specific information is extracted to be processed by a different pipeline.


There are plenty of tools for scraping data on a website. We can count for some three most well-known including Scrapy, Beautifulsoup, and Selenium that have their own unique strengths to scrap data from various websites.
In this task, I have done Instagram scraping through Selenium and Beautifulsoup libraries. More specifically, Selenium takes into account a robust tool for scraping. One of the reasons is that it is able to handle automation in a complex way.
